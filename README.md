**Note: [Kotlin For Forge](https://modrinth.com/mod/kotlin-for-forge) v5.6+ is required for this mod to work**

Have your dogs ever been slain in battle valiatly protecting you?

Has your cat ever walked straight into an open pit of lava for no reason?

Did you accidentally feed your parrot a cookie?

Fear not, for with new microchip technology you can not only locate your pets, but also copy their entire genetic code, and with some "raw materials" physically rebuild them!

**This mod is a work in progress, expect bad ui, missing features, and lots of bugs :P**
